The ping pong game project is a web-based game currently in progress, designed to be simple yet entertaining, with basic controls and fast-paced gameplay. The game is being created using HTML/CSS and JavaScript, with plans to add different difficulty levels and game modes to keep players engaged. I am putting in my efforts to ensure the game is smooth and bug-free, with a goal of providing a fun and engaging gaming experience to the players.
